A Peek Into The World of ChrisValSilva

Hello Lovelies & Gents!!!

I'm just a creative soul looking to grasp the ins and outs of coding. I first became intrigued by coding while I was ironically editing code on my Tumblr blog pages. I didn't even realize that that was what I was doing until I started to research what coding was. Now I'm excited to learn as much as I can!!!!
